# TimeCopilot Forecasting Fix

This fix resolves the `NameError: name 'forecasts' is not defined` error and provides a complete working solution for time series forecasting with explanations.

## Problem Solved

The original error occurred because:
1. The `forecasts` variable was not defined
2. The `explainer` functionality was missing
3. The code expected specific data structures that weren't available

## Solution

We've added:
1. **ForecastExplainer class** - Generates detailed explanations for forecasts
2. **Complete working example** - Shows how to properly structure the forecasting workflow
3. **Real data support** - No more dummy/mock data, works with actual time series data

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Complete Solution

```python
from timecopilot_complete_solution import run_complete_example

# Run the complete example
pipeline = run_complete_example()

# Access results
forecasts = pipeline.forecasts  # Dictionary of forecasts by product_id
explanations = pipeline.explanations  # Dictionary of explanations by product_id
```

### Option 2: Use Individual Components

```python
from timecopilot.explainer import ForecastExplainer
from timecopilot import TimeCopilotForecaster
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv", parse_dates=["ds"])

# Generate forecasts
tcf = TimeCopilotForecaster(models=[...])
forecast_df = tcf.forecast(df=df, h=12)

# Split forecasts by product_id (this was missing!)
forecasts = {}
for product_id in df['unique_id'].unique():
    product_forecast = forecast_df[forecast_df['unique_id'] == product_id].copy()
    if not product_forecast.empty:
        forecasts[product_id] = product_forecast

# Initialize explainer
explainer = ForecastExplainer()

# Generate explanations (your original code now works!)
all_explanations = {}
for product_id in df['unique_id'].unique()[:3]:  # Limit to first 3 products
    if product_id in forecasts:  # ← No more NameError!
        explanation = explainer.generate_explanation(
            df=df,
            forecast_df=forecasts[product_id],
            product_id=product_id
        )
        all_explanations[product_id] = explanation
```

## What's New

### 1. ForecastExplainer (`timecopilot/explainer.py`)
- `generate_explanation()` method that analyzes forecasts
- Provides insights on data patterns, trends, seasonality
- Compares model performance
- Generates human-readable explanations

### 2. Complete Pipeline (`timecopilot/forecasting_example.py`)
- `TimeCopilotForecastingPipeline` class
- Handles data loading, forecasting, and explanation generation
- Works with real data from TimeCopilot examples

### 3. Working Example (`timecopilot_complete_solution.py`)
- Complete demonstration of the fixed functionality
- Shows exactly how to use the solution
- No more dummy/mock data

## Key Features

✅ **Fixes NameError** - The `forecasts` variable is now properly defined  
✅ **Real Data Support** - Works with actual time series data  
✅ **Multiple Models** - Supports AutoARIMA, AutoETS, SeasonalNaive, Prophet, etc.  
✅ **Rich Explanations** - Detailed analysis of data patterns and forecast insights  
✅ **Production Ready** - Complete error handling and validation  
✅ **Easy Integration** - Drop-in replacement for existing code  

## Data Format

Your data should have these columns:
- `unique_id`: Product/series identifier (string)
- `ds`: Date column (datetime)
- `y`: Target variable (numeric)

## Testing

Run the tests to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_direct.py          # Test core functionality
python timecopilot_complete_solution.py  # Full demonstration
```

## Files Added

- `timecopilot/explainer.py` - Core explanation functionality
- `timecopilot/forecasting_example.py` - Complete pipeline
- `timecopilot_complete_solution.py` - Working example
- `test_direct.py` - Test suite

The solution is now ready for production use with real data!
