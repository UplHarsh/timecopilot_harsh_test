# TimeCopilot Weekend Exploration Project

A hands-on exploration of TimeCopilot's forecasting capabilities using real-world data. This project demonstrates how AI can automatically select the best forecasting models and provide intelligent explanations in plain English.

## Project Overview

This weekend project shows off TimeCopilot's two main strengths:

1. **Intelligent Forecasting Engine**: Automatically compares multiple models and picks the best one
2. **AI Reasoning Layer**: Explains forecasts in natural language and answers your questions

## Datasets & Use Cases

### 1. **Bitcoin Price Prediction** (`bitcoin_analysis.py`)
- **Dataset**: Historical Bitcoin prices from 2020-2024
- **Challenge**: Cryptocurrency is notoriously volatile and hard to predict
- **What you'll learn**: How different models handle extreme price swings

### 2. **Energy Demand Forecasting** (`energy_demand.py`) 
- **Dataset**: Hourly electricity consumption patterns
- **Challenge**: Multiple overlapping seasonal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **What you'll learn**: How AI handles complex recurring patterns

### 3. **E-commerce Sales Forecasting** (`ecommerce_sales.py`)
- **Dataset**: Monthly retail sales including promotional periods
- **Challenge**: Growth trends mixed with irregular promotional spikes
- **What you'll learn**: How to forecast business metrics with external events

## Technical Features

- **Foundation Models**: Integration with TimesFM and other cutting-edge models
- **Smart Model Selection**: Compares multiple algorithms and picks the best performer
- **Cross-Validation**: Tests model accuracy on historical data before making predictions
- **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions about your forecasts in plain English
- **Professional Visualizations**: Clean charts and dashboards for presentations

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install what you need
pip install timecopilot pandas matplotlib seaborn yfinance

# Run any of the examples
python bitcoin_analysis.py
python energy_demand.py
python ecommerce_sales.py

# Or try the interactive version
jupyter notebook interactive_playground.ipynb
```

## What You'll Get

Each script produces:
- **Smart Model Selection**: See which algorithm works best for your data type
- **Visual Forecasts**: Clean charts with confidence intervals
- **AI Explanations**: Plain English explanations of what the forecast means
- **Performance Metrics**: How accurate each model is
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask follow-up questions about the results

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this project, you'll understand:

1. How TimeCopilot automatically picks the best forecasting model
2. Why some models work better than others for different data types
3. How to interpret confidence intervals and forecast reliability
4. How to ask good questions to get useful insights from AI
5. How ensemble methods make forecasts more robust
