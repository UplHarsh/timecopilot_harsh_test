## Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# Set up your environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run any example
python bitcoin_analysis.py
python energy_demand.py  
python ecommerce_sales.py

# Or try the interactive version
jupyter notebook interactive_playground.ipynb
```

## What Each Example Shows

### Bitcoin Analysis (`bitcoin_analysis.py`)
- **Focus**: Cryptocurrency price forecasting
- **Data**: Real Bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance (last 3 years)
- **Challenge**: High volatility and unpredictable price swings
- **What you'll learn**: How models handle extreme market conditions

### Energy Demand (`energy_demand.py`)
- **Focus**: Multi-seasonal pattern recognition  
- **Data**: Synthetic hourly electricity consumption
- **Challenge**: Daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns all overlapping
- **What you'll learn**: Complex seasonality forecasting

### E-commerce Sales (`ecommerce_sales.py`)
- **Focus**: Business forecasting with promotional effects
- **Data**: Synthetic daily sales with growth trends
- **Challenge**: Regular patterns mixed with irregular promotional spikes
- **What you'll learn**: How to forecast business metrics

### Interactive Playground (`interactive_playground.ipynb`)
- **Focus**: Step-by-step learning
- **Data**: Apple stock data (downloaded live)
- **Challenge**: Real financial data with market volatility
- **What you'll learn**: Hands-on experience with the full workflow

## Core TimeCopilot Features

### Intelligent Forecasting Engine
- Automatic model selection from multiple algorithms
- Foundation model integration (TimesFM, etc.)
- Cross-validation and performance comparison  
- Ensemble methods and confidence intervals

### AI Reasoning Layer
- Natural language query interface
- AI-generated insights and explanations
- Pattern recognition and interpretation
- Risk assessment and business recommendations

## Learning Path

### Beginner (30 minutes)
1. Read the README
2. Run `interactive_playground.ipynb`
3. Try asking a few questions

### Intermediate (1-2 hours)  
1. Run all three Python examples
2. Compare how models perform on different data types
3. Experiment with different questions
4. Look at the generated charts

### Advanced (2-3 hours)
1. Try using your own data in place of the examples
2. Experiment with different forecast horizons
3. Compare foundation models vs statistical models
4. Build custom analysis using the insights

## Tips for Better Results

### Getting Better AI Insights
- Ask specific questions about particular time periods
- Reference business context in your questions
- Ask about implications, not just technical details
- Use follow-up questions to dig deeper

### Understanding Model Performance
- Foundation models work well with longer time series
- Statistical models excel at clear seasonal patterns  
- Ensemble methods provide more reliable forecasts
- Always check cross-validation results for accuracy

### Troubleshooting
- Make sure OpenAI API key is set correctly
- Check internet connection for data downloads
- Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Use Python 3.8+ for best compatibility

## What You'll Get

Each example produces:
- **Model Selection Results**: See which algorithm works best
- **Visual Forecasts**: Clean charts with confidence bands
- **AI Insights**: Plain English explanations
- **Performance Metrics**: Model accuracy comparisons
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask follow-up questions

**Total Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Difficulty**: Beginner friendly  
**Value**: Hands-on experience with modern AI forecasting
